            "It is a very simple app that mostly follows the basic tutorial from <a href='https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html' target='_blank'>rubyonrails.org</a>. " +

            "It took me some time to understand how everything works, and it was mostly because I was surprised by how many things happened automatically due to naming conventions. " +

            "I found this awesome method called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering\" target=\"_blank\"> collaborative filtering</a>, " +
            "which is a nice way to find similar items based on user behavior. Basically, we represent each user and video as a vector like this: " +
            "user1 = [0.53, -0.61, ...]. And it is then possible to calculate the dot product of the users and the videos to find the best matches. " +
            "<br /> <br/>The model learns the vector embeddings by minimizing the difference between the predicted and the actual watch time. " +
            "To do this I needed to make a simulation of the user behaviour. So for example a user that is very interested in gaming is more likely to click on a gaming video. " +
            "And then depending on the user\'s interest and the video\'s quality, I simulated how much they watched. " +
            "<br/> <br/>All the interesting things happens in Python, but I also created a frontend using Next.js. " +
            "I am still not convinced that we need such heavy javascript frameworks, but I was able to find a lot of documentation for it, which is nice for a junior developer like me. " +
            "<br/> <br/>If you are interested, I made a YouTube video, where I explain a bit more about what I did, and some of the problems I ran into. " +
            "The most interesting part was how to handle new users and new videos, since you want to quickly be able to predict the vector embeddings, " +
            "and also handle a tradeoff between showing new videos and showing the once the model already knows are good. " +
            "<br/> <br/>I ended up using Thompson sampling which is a method to both determine video quality, but also to handle the explore / exploit tradeoff. " +
            "I also invented a technique to handle the cold start problem. Basically it sets the embeddings to a weighted average of the users that watched it, where " +
            "the weight is the watch time.",

        description: "In my previous job, I experimented with using vector embeddings to match projects with employees. " +
            "<br/><br/><b>The challenge:</b> Our customers (companies) were bidding on projects, and used to spend hours reading through the project files " +
            "to identify the right employees for the project. We already had structured employee data including skill levels, but the projects were just unstructured pdf files. " +
            "You could ask the user to manually type 'we need a person with level 8 in web design and 7 in project management...' but this would take forever, and require " +
            "that the user would read through all of the project files (sometimes 100+ pages)." +
            "<br/><br/><b>The solution:</b> We used OpenAI\'s Assistant API to upload the project files to their vector storage. " +
            "We could then ask the LLM to extract the needed project roles including a description. So it would for example suggest 2 web designers, " +
            "2 web developers, 1 project manager and so on. For each of them, it would describe the type of skills and experiences that were required. " +
            "The user could edit these roles and descriptions.<br/><br/>We would then use OpenAI\'s embeddings API to transform this into a vector representation " +
            "and match the descriptions with the existing vector representations of the employees. We even highlighted relevant skills and experiences, " +
            "and generated a short description of why the employee was a good fit and presented alternatives. " +
            "<br/><br/><b>My role:</b> I was the product manager, and was responsible for shaping the solution together with a developer and designer. " +
            "I did not design the actual pixels, but worked along our designer to come up with how it should work. " +
            "Since the developer on the project had little experience with AI, I designed the data flow, and figured out which APIs we should use and how. " +
            "<b>I also coded a basic prototype in Next.js</b> to test that it was feasible to get it working." +
            "<br/><br/><b>Evaluation:</b> It is cool that we were able to build this. A few years ago it would have been very difficult to solve this problem " +
            "but with the new LLM technology, it only required some creative thinking. " +
            "I do not like the reliance on other companies APIs, since your ability to achieve better results and not having downtime is reliant on another company. " +
            "I would therefore be very interested in using a self-hosted LLM like LLama, but this was not possible with the companies infrastructure at the time.",

            "Nobody wanted to post reviews because nobody else was. So even though I tried to get it started, the app never took off. " +
            "<br/><br/><b>Learnings:</b> It was not my first full-stack application, but nice to get some repetition. " +
            "I honestly learned more about the business side of things rather than coding. " +
