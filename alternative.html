                    Words on a page only go so far. In this short video, I share a bit about my journey, 
                    what excites me specifically about this role at 37signals, and why I'm eager to learn and contribute.

                <h2>The role</h2>
                <p>
                    I really love programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was in 8th grade I thought that I was going to be a programmer.
                    But I also became really interested in the business side of things, and ended up working as a product manager while studying at Copenhagen Business School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>But I kept coming back to programming.</b> I would code in my spare time. I would do data analysis in Python. 
                    I would code up prototypes to show the developers from my old work that our ideas could be implemented.
                    <b>Whenever I have the opportunity, I code - and time just flies by.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only do I love programming, I also like to build things that solves real problems. 
                    I like shaping ideas. I do not believe that there is such a thing as a perfect solution
                    for anything. Because all solutions are a compromise in some way.
                    <b>But there is always a way to prioritize the most important things.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I don't know why this is such a beautiful idea to me. But to me, there is just
                    something profound about getting to the point, and building something that does
                    what it should do - and nothing more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love to join 37signals. I am sure I would be able to bring good energy and taste, while learning a lot from you.

                <h2>The company</h2>
                <p>
                    There is one reason, I would love to work for you specifically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's your philosophy. For several years now, I have been showing your products to my colleagues. 
                    I have been following your launches, listened to your podcasts, and read your books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have become fascinated by <b>not only how you build products, but also how you build and run the company.</b>
                    You are questioniong the most foundational ideas such as "Why do we need to grow?".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having worked at a "traditional startup", I have really started to believe that <b>the way you run a company is just as important as the products you build.</b>
                    I am so tired of investors making questionable decisions and not thinking about what the customers actually need or want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love to work for a company that understands that it doesn't have to be crazy at work. 
                    A company that is not afraid of saying what they believe in, especially when it is different from what other companies are doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your way of working has proven successful for decades, and <b>I would love to be part of that thoughtful, sustainable approach.</b>
                    I believe that it is in such an enviornment that I can grow and contribute the most as a person and as a professional.

                <p>
                    Oh also, I am so interested in the intersection of technology and business that I made a YouTube channel about it. My most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVHnguyd06g" target="_blank">popular video</a> is about why Midjourney got so successful so fast.
