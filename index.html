                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2024 I graduated from Copenhagen Business School with a master's degree in Business Administration and Information Systems. 
                    While that is cool, I would much rather talk about my coding journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While studying I worked as a product manager, and through that I started learning about 37signals and read several of your books!
                    I really liked the <span class="no-bullshit">no-bullshit</span> approach to business and software development. 
                    And I realized that product managers are not really needed - the developers and designers should be able to do their jobs without the middleman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I therefore want to get a job as a junior developer - and my dream workplace is 37signals. 
                    I want to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn from the best</li>
                        <li>Develop great products that people love</li>
                        <li>Solve problems that solve <i>actual</i> user needs</li>
                        <li>Come up with creative yet simple solutions to complex problems</li>
                        <li>Work in a collaborative environment with great people</li>
                    </ul>

                        Well, some people do at least. But I just really wanted to use that headline - hope you get the reference. Here are some nice words from people I have worked with in the past:

                <div class="why-hire-me-content">
                    <p>
                        I am really curious and a very fast learner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about making great products that solve real problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a great team player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly, 37signals has already taught me so much about how to make great products. I would be <i>so</i> excited to specifically work with you! I do not believe you will find anyone else who is so excited about your methodology and products.
