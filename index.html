                    Words on a page only go so far. In this short video, I share a bit about my journey, 
                    what excites me specifically about this role at 37signals, and why I'm eager to learn and contribute.

                <h2>Here's who I am</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2024 I graduated from Copenhagen Business School with a master's degree in Business Administration and Information Systems. 
                    While that is cool, I would much rather talk about my coding journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my studies, I worked as a product manager in a small company. That experience was valuable, but it also showed me the potential 
                    friction that can arise without clear communication and empowered teams.
                    Discovering 37signals' books (like Rework and Shape Up) was eye-opening. Your emphasis on empowering small, 
                    focused teams, trusting them to build great things without unnecessary layers, deeply resonated. 
                    I admire the <b>no-bullshit</b>, pragmatic approach you practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it was fun to work as a product manager, I realized that I want to be a developer. Because <b>whenever I did programming, 
                    time would always just fly by</b>. That's why I'm shifting my career focus, and I'm eager specifically at 37signals to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn the product and programming craft from the best</li>
                    <li>Contribute to great products that shows that less can be more</li>
                    <li>Tackle <i>actual</i> user needs with simple solutions</li>
                    <li>Thrive in your environment that emphasizes clear writing, focus, and collaboration</li>

                    Here are a few projects where I've applied my skills and tried to practice principles like simplicity and user focus.

                <div class="why-hire-me-content">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Curiosity and Proactive Learning:</strong> 
                        You value continuous learning. I'm naturally curious and driven to learn quickly â€“ as demonstrated by for example my YouTube algorithm project.
                        I'm excited to dive deep into the 37signals way of building.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Pragmatic Product Mindset:</strong> 
                        My background gives me perspective on building things people actually use. 
                        I share your passion for solving real problems with simple, well-crafted software, 
                        avoiding unnecessary features (inspired by your 'less is more' philosophy, as seen in my employee-project matching project).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Clear Communication & Collaboration:</strong> 
                        I understand clear writing is essential at 37signals. Whether it's code comments, documentation (like the README for this site), 
                        or asynchronous communication, I prioritize clarity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Deep Alignment & Enthusiasm:</strong> 
                        37signals' philosophy isn't just theory I've read; it's fundamentally shaped how I want to build software. 
                        The chance to learn directly from the team that embodies these principles truly excites me, and I believe my 
                        unique journey brings a valuable perspective.
